# RS-Quest-Viewer
A collection of python scripts that scrapes the Runescape Wiki website for various quest data including the skill and quest requirements. The scraped data is put into a JSON format to be distributed, but also for me to use as a "Data Source" for a simple react page that will display this data to a user.
