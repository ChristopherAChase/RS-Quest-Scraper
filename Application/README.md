# Quest Viewer Application
This basic react web application is a support tool for the game "Runescape". Its main purpose is to provide players/users a list of quests, details about that quest, and the requirements for it.

## Interface
The application's interface will consist of a large table with each row representing one quest.

To the left of the table will be section for the user to enter their username into a search bar, along with filtering options, based on the information they want to see.
- After searching for their username, the table will reflect which quests they've completed, which ones they haven't completed but have all the requirements for, and which ones they haven't completed, and are missing at least one of the requirements.

Each column of the table will be sortable so the user will be able to see their data, how they want to see it.

## Purpose for Creation
- I happen to enjoy this game quite a bit, and found that this information was the most appealing to me, but was impossible to find all in one location.
  - The closest I found was an excel spreadsheet that someone would have to manually enter their skill levels, and select which quests they have previously completed, and then they could see which quests they meet the requirements for. This was obviously a solid effort, but not convenient enough for my taste.
- I aim to brush up on my Javascript/React skills and challenge myself by creating something that is useful, but challenging, and requires knowledge of various development aspects, such as state, hooks, and more.
